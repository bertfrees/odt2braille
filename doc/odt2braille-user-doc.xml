            <level2>
               <h2>Installation</h2>
               <p>In order to install odt2braille, OpenOffice.org version 3.0 or later is required. You can find the latest version of OpenOffice.org at <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/other.html" external="true">http://download.openoffice.org/other.html</a>. It is strongly recommended that you also download and install the <em>SimBraille</em> font: <a href="http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/extra/simbrl.ttf" external="true">http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/extra/simbrl.ttf</a>. To add the odt2braille extension, launch OpenOffice.org and open [<em>Tools &gt; Extension Manager...</em>]. First remove any older versions of odt2braille. Then choose <em>Add...</em>, select the odt2braille installation package and follow the steps. Finally, when the installation is finished, restart OpenOffice.org. </p>
               <p>You can download the latest version of odt2braille from <a href="http://odt2braille.sourceforge.net/downloads.html" external="true">http://odt2braille.sourceforge.net/downloads.html</a>.</p>

               <h2>OpenOffice.org Accessibility</h2>
               <p>OpenOffice.org is poorly accessible with traditional screen readers on Windows. Accessing OpenOffice.org with the newer screen reader NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) appears to work better. Mac OS users can access OpenOffice.org with VoiceOver; Linux users can access it with Orca.</p>

               <h2>Introduction</h2>
               <p>In this guide you will learn how to create a document in OpenOffice.org Writer and prepare it for Braille production. Chapter 1 explains all you have to know to get started real quickly. In chapter 2 you will find a more comprehensive reference. You can find more help on working with Writer at <a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Writer_Guide" external="true">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Writer_Guide</a>. </p>
               <p>After installing odt2braille, a whole new range of user preferences will become available. Because of the broad range of Braille formatting conventions in use worldwide, odt2braille provides a lot of flexibility. Users are able to adjust the Braille layout in detail, just like they can fully customize the print layout. </p>
               <p>To make sure that non-technical users will not be overwhelmed with possibilities, they have the option to choose from a series of <em>formal</em> Braille rules, e.g. the <em>BANA principles of print to Braille transcription</em> (see <a href="http://www.brl.org/formats/" external="true">http://www.brl.org/formats/</a>). This will considerably limit their freedom, but it will also greatly simplify the production of valid and well-formatted Braille. </p>
               <p>What follows next is a detailed overview of all possibilities odt2braille offers.</p>

               <p>Often, because documents are too long to be bound in one single Braille book, they are arranged in <em>volumes</em>. </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>Tip:</strong> Typically a volume should have around 80-90 one-sided pages (the page count includes all pages, including the preliminary pages). Ideally, the next volume starts at a logical place, such as the beginning of a new chapter. As a guideline, there should not be a difference of more than 15 pages between two volumes. </p>
               <p>Also, appendixes, glossaries, indexes, bibliographies etc. are often more useful when bound in separate <em>supplementary</em> volumes (<em>supplements</em>). Finally, the extended preliminary pages (i.e. with all preliminary content included) are sometimes bound in a separate <em>preliminary</em> volume, when the first volume would otherwise become to long. </p>
