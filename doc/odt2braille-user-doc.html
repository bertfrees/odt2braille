<h2 class="unnumbered">Getting Started</h2>

<p>The instructions are written for OpenOffice.org but should also work for LibreOffice.

<h3 class="heading">Installation</h3>

<p>In order to install odt2braille, OpenOffice.org version 3.0 or later is required. 
You can find the latest version of OpenOffice.org at <a href="http://download.openoffice.org/other.html">http://download.openoffice.org/other.html</a>. 
If you don't have <em>Java</em> installed on your system (verify your Java version at
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a>), make sure you include the
<em>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</em> to the download. Java 6 is required. If you choose not to download OpenOffice.org with Java
you can easily install Java afterwards. You can get the latest version from <a href="http://java.com/en/">http://java.com/en/</a>.

   <p>To add the odt2braille extension, launch OpenOffice.org and open [<em>Tools &gt; Extension Manager...</em>]. 
First remove any older versions of odt2braille. Then choose <em>Add...</em>, select the odt2braille
installation package and follow the steps. You can download the latest version from
<a href="http://odt2braille.sourceforge.net/downloads.html">http://odt2braille.sourceforge.net/downloads.html</a>.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure the installation package is an <em>.oxt</em> file. It might happen that Internet Explorer saves it as a
<em>.zip</em> file. In this case, just rename the file back to <em>.oxt</em>. 
</blockquote>

   <p>It is strongly recommended that you also download and install the SimBraille font from Duxbury Systems at
<a href="http://www.duxburysystems.com/product2.asp?product=The%20Braille%20TrueType%20Fonts&amp;level=free&amp;action=pur"">http://www.duxburysystems.com/product2.asp?product=The%20Braille%20TrueType%20Fonts&amp;level=free&amp;action=pur"</a>. As
of version 0.0.3, odtbraille will use his own <em>odt2braille fonts</em> instead:
<a href="http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/fonts/odt2braille6.ttf">http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/fonts/odt2braille6.ttf</a> for 6-dot
Braille and <a href="http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/fonts/odt2braille8.ttf">http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/odt2braille/Odt2BrailleAddOn/fonts/odt2braille8.ttf</a>
for 8-dot Braille.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure you install the fonts <em>after</em> the plugin has been installed. Doing it the other way around may cause
the Braille preview window to show a bunch of meaningless squares or periods instead of Braille symbols. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Finally, when everything is installed, restart OpenOffice.org and you're ready to go.

<h3 class="heading">OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice Accessibility</h3>

<p>OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice are poorly accessible with traditional screen readers on Windows. 
Accessing these office suites with the newer screen reader NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access
<a href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">http://www.nvda-project.org/</a>) appears to work better. Mac OS users can access OpenOffice.org
with VoiceOver (<a href="http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/">http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover/</a>); Linux users can access it
with Orca (<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Orca">http://live.gnome.org/Orca</a>). (Some screen readers may provide good access to the
user interface but not to document content, for example, the text alternative for an image.) 
However, access to OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice does not necessarily imply that the user interface
of an extension is accessible in the same way. The odt2braille project would greatly appreciate any
feedback about the accessibility of the extension (with information on which
OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice version, which screen reader version, which operating system,
etcetera you use the extension).

<h3 class="heading">Introduction</h3>

<p>This guide explains how to create a document in OpenOffice.org Writer and prepare it for Braille
production. Chapter 1 explains all you have to know to get started real quickly. In chapter 2 you will find
a more comprehensive reference. You can find more help on working with Writer at
<a href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Writer_Guide">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOo3_User_Guides/Writer_Guide</a>.

   <p>After installing odt2braille, a whole new range of user preferences will become available. 
Because of the broad range of Braille formatting conventions in use worldwide, odt2braille provides a lot of
flexibility. Users are able to adjust the Braille layout in detail, just like they can fully customize
the print layout.

   <p>To make sure that non-technical users will not be overwhelmed with possibilities, they have the option to choose
from a series of <em>formal</em> Braille rules, e.g. the <em>BANA principles of print to Braille transcription</em>
(see <a href="http://www.brl.org/formats/">http://www.brl.org/formats/</a>). This will considerably limit their freedom, but it will also greatly
simplify the production of valid and well-formatted Braille.

   <p>What follows next is a detailed overview of all possibilities odt2braille offers.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Languages</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				OpenOffice.org allows you to write documents in various languages or mix multiple languages within the
				same document. You can set the language for the whole document, individual paragraphs, or even
				individual words and characters. The language tools can be found in [<em>Tools &gt; Languages</em>]. 
				<li>				Languages can be associated with <em>Braille translation tables</em> in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings…</em>]. The
				translation table for the whole document can be set with the main language option
				on the <em>General</em> tab. A contraction level can also be chosen. If the document contains
				multiple languages, each additional language can be linked to a translation table and contraction
				level in the <em>Languages</em> tab. 
				<li>				Translation tables are available for all Western European languages, Modern Hebrew, some Asian languages
				and even some minority languages like Gaelic and Esperanto. 
			</ul>

   <p>	<a name="Paragraphs"></a>

   <p>	

<h3 class="section">2.2 Paragraphs</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In OpenOffice.org, all regular text between <em>¶
 markers</em> is considered a paragraph
				(¶
 markers can be made visible by selecting [<em>View &gt; Nonprinting Characters</em>]). 
				<li>				Each paragraph has got a formatting <em>style</em>. Paragraph styles can be assigned and modified in
				[<em>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting (F11)</em>]. 
				<li>				All paragraphs will be transcribed as Braille paragraphs, except
				
          <ul>
					<li>					<a href="#Headings">headings</a>
,
					<li>					<a href="#Captions">captions</a>
,
					<li>					paragraphs inside a <a href="#Lists">list</a>
,
					<li>					inside a <a href="#Tables">table</a>
,
					<li>					inside a <a href="#Notes">note</a>
,
					<li>					or on the <a href="#Title-Page">title page</a>
. 
				</ul>
     			</ul>

   <p>		

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				By default, paragraphs are rendered in <em>indented paragraph style</em> (first line cell 3, runovers cell 1
				and	not separated by blank lines. 
				<li>				Paragraph settings can be altered in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Paragraphs</em>]. You can link each used
				paragraph style with a different Braille formatting style. 
				<li>				Braille formatting settings for paragraphs include spacing, alignment and margins. You can control
				how many lines of a paragraph must be printed at least at the bottom of a page (<em>Orphan control</em>). 
				Moreover, you can protect a paragraph from being split across multiple pages (<em>Don't split</em>),
				and you can keep a paragraph together with the first line of the next (<em>Keep with next</em>). 
				<li>				By default, empty paragraphs are dropped in the Braille edition. By checking the option
				<em>Keep empty paragraphs</em>, an empty paragraph is brailled as an empty line. 
			</ul>

   <p>	<a name="Headings"></a>

   <p>	

<h3 class="section">2.3 Headings</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In order for a paragraph to be interpreted by odt2braille as a <em>heading</em>,
				following conditions must be true:

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					An <em>outline level</em> has to be assigned to the text. 
					This can be achieved in two ways:

          <p>					
               <ul>
						<li>						Outline levels can be permanently linked to paragraph styles in [<em>Tools &gt; Outline Numbering</em>]. 
						<li>						If no outline level is linked to the current paragraph style, a level can still be assigned
						to the text by setting <em>Outline Level</em> in [<em>Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Outline &amp; Numbering</em>]. 
					</ul>

          <p>					By default, the paragraph styles <em>Heading 1</em>, <em>Heading 2</em>, etc. have outline levels 1, 2, etc. 
					The navigator [<em>View &gt; Navigator (F5)</em>] provides an overview of all headings in a document
					and the outline levels. 
					<li>					In addition, a heading should not be placed on the <a href="#Title-Page">title page</a>
 or inside a
					<a href="#Lists">list</a>
, <a href="#Tables">table</a>
 or <a href="#Notes">note</a>
. 
				</ul>

     <p>				<li>				To enable automatic numbering or bulleting of headings, set <em>Numbering Style</em>
				[<em>Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Outline &amp; Numbering</em>] to <em>Outline Numbering</em>. 
				<li>				The exact formatting of bullets and numbers can be determined in [<em>Tools - Outline Numbering</em>]. 
				Alternatively, choose [<em>Format &gt; Bullets &amp; Numbering</em>] when a heading has the cursor. 
			</ul>

   <p>		

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In Braille, headings are rendered as follows:

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					Level 1 headings are centered and preceded and followed by a blank line. 
					<li>					Level 2 headings are centered as well but are only preceded by a blank line. 
					<li>					Level 3 headings begin in cell 5 (runovers too) and are preceded by a blank line. 
					<li>					Headings with an outline level greater than 3 begin in cell 1 (runovers too) and are preceded by a blank line. 
				</ul>

     <p>				All these settings can be altered in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Headings</em>]. 
				<li>				As with paragraphs, you can set spacing, alignment and margins, you can protect a heading from being split across
				multiple pages, and you can keep a heading together with the first line of the following heading or paragraph. 
				<li>				In addition, you can make a heading start on a new page. 
				<li>				Numbers of headings are completely adopted in Braille. 
				<li>				Bullets inside headings are automatically removed. 
				<li>				Empty headings are automatically removed. 
				<li>				All <a href="#Special-Typeface">special typeface</a>
 in a heading is ignored. 
				<li>				Only headings inside the <em>body</em> of the document (not in the preliminary section)
				are included in the <a href="#Table-of-Contents">table of contents</a>
. 
				<li>				Footnotes in headings: see <a href="#Notes">Notes</a>. 
				<li>				When a regular <a href="#Volume-Management">volume</a>
 (not a preliminary or supplementary volume) doesn't
				start with a heading, odt2braille inserts a <em>continuation heading</em>: the closest preceding heading is repeated
				and suffixed with the string "<kbd>(Cont.)</kbd>". This continuation heading is included in the table of contents as well. 
				<blockquote>
<b>Tip:</b> Always start a volume with a heading. 
</blockquote>

     <p>			</ul>

   <p>	<a name="Lists"></a>

   <p>	

<h3 class="section">2.4 Lists</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				Each paragraph with a <em>Numbering Style</em> [<em>Format &gt; Paragraph &gt; Outline &amp; Numbering</em>]
				that is not <em>Outline Numbering</em> or <em>None</em>, will be interpreted by odt2braille as an item of a list. 
				<li>				To produce a numbered or bulleted list in OpenOffice.org, either use the <em>numbering</em> and <em>bullets</em>
				icons, or use <em>list styles</em>.

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					The numbering and bullets icons can be found on the <em>Formatting</em> toolbar
					[<em>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Formatting</em>] or the <em>Bullets and Numbering</em> toolbar
					[<em>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Bullets and Numbering</em>]. 
					<li>					List styles can be selected in [<em>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting &gt; List Styles</em>]. 
					When creating a new list style, make sure the name is not of the form <kbd>L1</kbd> / <kbd>L2</kbd> / <small class="enddots">....</small>
				</ul>

     <p>				<li>				The <em>level</em> of a list item can be modified with keyboard shortcuts (<span class="sc">tab</span> to move down a level,
				<span class="sc">shift</span> + <span class="sc">tab</span> to move up a level) or with the <em>Bullets and Numbering</em> toolbar. 
				<li>				The exact formatting of lists can be determined in [<em>Format &gt; Bullets and Numbering</em>]. 
				Alternatively, if the list was created using list styles [<em>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting &gt; List Styles</em>],
				right click on the list style and choose <em>Modify</em>. 
			</ul>

   <p>		

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				All Braille formatting settings for lists can be altered in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Lists</em>]. 
				<li>				By default, lists are brailled as follows:

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					Level 1 list items begin in cell 1, runovers begin in cell 5. 
					<li>					Level 2 list items begin in cell 3, runovers in cell 7. 
					<li>					Level 3 list items begin in cell 5, runovers in cell 9. 
					<li>					List items with an outline level greater than 3 begin in cell 7, runovers in cell 11. 
				</ul>

     <p>				The entire list is preceded and following by a blank line.

     <p>				<li>				Numbers of list items are completely adopted in Braille. 
				<li>				The user can determine how bullets are brailled. 
				<li>				List items or entire lists can be protected from being split across pages. 
				<li>				<a href="#Textboxes">Textboxes</a>
 and <a href="#Images">images</a>
 that are anchored to a list item are
				rendered only after completion of the entire list. 
			</ul>

   <p>	<a name="Tables"></a>

   <p>	

<h3 class="section">2.5 Tables</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In OpenOffice.org, tables are created with [<em>Table &gt; Insert &gt; Table</em>] or [<em>Insert &gt; Table</em>]
				or with the <em>Table</em> toolbar [<em>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Table</em>]. 
				<li>				The first row(s) of a table can be defined as <em>column headings</em> by checking the <em>Headings</em> box. 
				Set multiple heading rows by checking <em>Repeat headings</em>. 
				<li>				To add a <a href="#Captions">caption</a>
 to the table, place the cursor inside the table and choose
				[<em>Insert &gt; Caption</em>]. In order for a table caption to be correctly linked to the table,
				it must be placed directly beneath the table and no other frame
				(i.e. <a href="#Textboxes">textbox</a>
 or <a href="#Images">image</a>
) can be anchored to it. 
			</ul>

   <p>		

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In Braille, tables are by default rendered in <em>stairstep format</em>:

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					Column 1 table cells begin in cell 1, runovers too. 
					<li>					Column 2 table cells begin in cell 3, runovers too. 
					<li>					<small class="enddots">....</small>
					<li>					Table cells in column 10 and beyond begin in cell 19. 
				</ul>

     <p>				<li>				However, is it also possible to render tables in <em>linear format</em>. In this case, all cells in a table row
				are joined together. The user can choose the <em>column delimiter</em> symbol which separates the cells. 
				<li>				Table rows can be protected from being split across Braille pages. 
				<li>				All table settings can be accessed in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Tables</em>]. 
				<li>				Only regular text is retained in a table cell, all other elements are dropped or transposed. 
				If a table cell contains multiple paragraphs, these are first serialized. 
				<li>				Table lines are only shown in Braille if they are present in print. 
				A table line is represented by a series of unspaced Braille dots 2356 (top table line) or 1245
				(bottom table line), extended across the full width of the Braille page. 
				A table inside a larger textbox is enclosed by full table lines (Braille dots 123456). 
				If no table lines are shown in print, the table is preceded and/or followed by a blank line. 
				<li>				If column headings are present, these table rows are separated from the table body by a series of
				unspaced Braille dots 25, extended across the full width of the Braille page. 
				<li>				If a <a href="#Captions">caption</a>
 is correctly linked to the table, it is centered and placed directly
				below the top table line (or top blank line if the table line is absent). 
				A blank line is inserted between the caption and the actual table content. 
				<li>				All <a href="#Notes">footnotes</a>
 are collected beneath the table body, but above the bottom table line
				(or bottom blank line if the table line is absent). 
				Footnotes in the table caption are placed directly below the caption. 
				<li>				Empty table cells are indicated with an ellipsis (Braille dots 5-5-5). 
				This usage is explained on the <a href="#Transcriber_0027s-Notes">transcriber's notes page</a>
. 
				<li>				When a table contains other tables, <a href="#Lists">lists</a>
, <a href="#Textboxes">textboxes</a>
 or
				<a href="#Images">images</a>
, these elements are moved outside the table. 
				Every transposition is indicated by a double dash (Braille dots 36-36-36-36) at the element's original location. 
				An explaining <a href="#Transcriber_0027s-Notes">transcriber's note</a>
 is inserted before the table. 
				Only after completion of the entire table, all previously omitted material is rendered. 
				Each element is preceded by another transcriber's note explaining it was moved from it's original location. 
				<blockquote>
<b>Tip:</b> Do not place other tables, lists, textboxes or images inside a table. 
</blockquote>

     <p>				<li>				A merged table cell is processed as if its whole content were in the left- and uppermost 'sub'-cell. 
				The other (empty) 'sub'-cells are not shown in Braille. This currently also applies to right-to-left
				writing systems such as Hebrew. 
				<blockquote>
<b>Tip:</b> Try to avoid merged cells.

     <p>			</ul>

   <p>	<a name="Textboxes"></a>

   <p>	

<h3 class="section">2.6 Textboxes</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In OpenOffice.org, textboxes can be produced by choosing [<em>Insert &gt; Frame</em>]. 
				Options can be modified later in [<em>Format &gt; Frame/Object</em>]. 
				On the <em>Type</em> tab, the anchor type can be selected. 
				The anchor is the basis of the position and behavior of the textbox within a document. 
				It makes the textbox move with the object it is anchored to. 
				You can anchor frames as a character or to a page, paragraph, or character. 
				In addition, if a textbox has been placed inside another textbox, it can be anchored to this outer frame. 
				The anchor is symbolized by a gray marker, which is only visible if the textbox is selected. 
				<li>				To add a <a href="#Captions">caption</a>
 to the textbox, place the cursor inside the textbox and choose
				[<em>Insert &gt; Caption</em>]. In order for a caption to be correctly linked to the textbox by odt2braille,
				one of the following must be true:

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					The textbox is anchored to a caption.

<h3 class="section">2.16 Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p>		A transcriber's note is a note that is added in the Braille edition by the transcriber but not
		shown in the print text. Some notes are inserted between other items in the document body,
		some notes are displayed on a separate <em>transcriber's note page</em> in the preliminary section.

     <ul>
				<li>				Transcriber's notes are automatically inserted by odt2braille. A user can only control whether or not
				a transcriber's note page is included in the preliminary pages, through the option
				Include transcriber's note page in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; General</em>]. 
				The transcriber's note page heading can be modified in the field
				below. By default, it is set to "<kbd>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</kbd>".

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				Transcriber's notes that appear throughout the document are brailled in <em>paragraph form</em>. A note
				consists of one or more <em>note paragraphs</em>. Each note paragraph begins in cell 7, runovers begin in
				cell 5. No blank lines are left before, after or between note paragraphs. 
				The complete note is preceded and followed by the unspaced <em>transcriber's note indicator</em> (Braille dots 6-3). 
				<li>				The transcriber's note page begins on a new Braille page. The heading is centered at the top of the page. 
				It is not included in the <a href="#Table-of-Contents">table of contents</a>
. 
				After a blank line the notes are listed. Notes are brailled as indented <a href="#Paragraphs">paragraphs</a>

     <p>				(first line cell 3, runovers cell 1, no blank lines between notes). No <em>transcriber's note indicators</em>
				are used. If the transcriber's note page doesn't contain any notes, it is not displayed.

<h3 class="section">2.17 Table of Contents</h3>

<p>		

<h4 class="subheading">OpenOffice.org</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				In OpenOffice, a table of contents can be added to the document by selecting
				[<em>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes and Tables</em>] and choosing <em>Table of Contents</em> for <em>Type</em>. 
				However, these tables are not adopted in the Braille version. Instead, odt2braille generates its own table of
				contents, and the user is given the option to include this table of contents
				in the preliminary pages of each volume. This option is found in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Table of Contents</em>]. 
				The table heading can be modified in the field below. By default, it is set to "<kbd>CONTENTS</kbd>". 
				<blockquote>
<b>Tip:</b> If a table of contents is present in print, include it in the Braille version also. 
</blockquote>

     <p>			</ul>

   <p>		

<h4 class="subheading">Braille</h4>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				The table of contents is rendered at the very end of the <a href="#Preliminary-Pages">preliminary section</a>
,
				before any possible <a href="#Notes">note sections</a>
. The table of contents begins on a new Braille page. 
				The heading is centered at the top of the page and followed by a blank line. 
				<li>				The actual content varies between volumes. On the <em>extended</em> preliminary pages (either included in the
				<a href="#Volume-Management">preliminary volume</a>
, if present, or in volume 1), the table of contents
				lists all headings in the entire document. Only headings in the <em>body</em> of the document are included. 
				In all other regular volumes, the table of contents is limited to headings in that particular volume. 
				No table of contents is included in supplementary volumes. 
				<li>				Each table entry is composed of

     <p>				
          <ul>
					<li>					the heading,
					<li>					[the <a href="#Page-Numbering">print page number</a>
, prefixed with the appropriate letter if the heading
					begins on a continued page], and
					<li>					[the Braille page number]
				</ul>

     <p>				Print and Braille page numbers in the table of contents can be enabled or disabled.

     <p>				<li>				By default, level 1 headings begin in cell 1, runovers in cell 5. Level 2 headings begin in cell 3, runovers
				in cell 7. Level 3 headings begin in cell 5, runovers in cell 9. Headings with an outline level greater than
				3 begin in cell 7, runovers in cell 11. All these settings can be altered
				in [<em>File &gt; Braille Settings &gt; Table of Contents</em>]. 
				<li>				The print and Braille page numbers are placed to end at the right margin of the Braille line on which the
				heading ends. If space allows it, a sequence of unspaced <em>guide dots</em>, preceded and followed by a blank cell,
				is inserted between the heading and the page numbers. The Braille symbol for these guide dots can be specified
				by the user, the default value is Braille dots 5.

     <ul>
				<li>				In OpenOffice.org, references to source material can be added through
				[<em>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Bibliography Entry</em>]. Although you can define sources within the
				document itself, creating and keeping a <em>bibliographic database</em> allows reuse in other documents and
				saves a lot of time. Select [<em>Tools &gt; Bibliography Database</em>] to show this database. 
				<li>				To generate a bibliography that lists all referenced sources, put the cursor where you want this bibliography
				to appear, then select [<em>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes and Tables</em>] and choose
				<em>Bibliography</em> for <em>Type</em>. The bibliography heading can be modified in the <em>Title</em> field. 
				<blockquote>

				<li>				In Braille, references to bibliography entries are rendered exactly as in print (the short name or a number
				enclosed by square brackets). 
				<li>				The bibliography begins on a new Braille page. On the first line, the heading is centered and followed by a
				blank line. It is not included in the <a href="#Table-of-Contents">table of contents</a>
. The actual
				bibliography entries are brailled like any other <a href="#Lists">list</a>
. Each item begins in cell 1, runovers
				in cell 3. The entries are translated literally, including <a href="#Special-Typeface">special typeface</a>

<h3 class="section">2.20 Inserting Literal Braille</h3>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				To insert Braille characters in the document that will be rendered identically in the Braille
				edition and the print edition, the transcriber has two possibilities. 
				
          <ul>
					<li>					In the <em>dot pattern entry mode</em>, Braille strings are specified by their dot
					patterns, e.g. 12-1235-1-24-123-123-15 (<em>"braille"</em> in uncontracted English Braille). 
					<li>					In the <em>six-key entry mode</em>, users can insert characters with the keys
					<kbd>S</kbd> (dot 3), <kbd>D</kbd> (dot 2), <kbd>F</kbd> (dot 1), <kbd>J</kbd> (dot 4), <kbd>K</kbd> (dot 5)
					and <kbd>L</kbd> (dot 6), as if they were using a mechanical embosser such as the
					Perkins Brailler. So to insert <em>"braille"</em>, type
					<kbd>D+F</kbd>, <kbd>S+D+F+K</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>D+J</kbd>, <kbd>S+D+F</kbd>, <kbd>S+D+F</kbd>, <kbd>F+K</kbd>. 
					Spaces are entered with the spacebar as usual and the <span class="sc">enter</span> / <span class="sc">return</span> key
					generates a hard return without starting a new paragraph. 
					<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Not all keyboards support this feature! 
</blockquote>

          <p>				</ul>

     <p>				These modes can be activated in the menu [<em>Insert &gt; Braille Characters</em>].

     <ul>
				<li>				Text can be formatted such that it will only be rendered in the Braille edition of the document,
				but not in the print edition. 
				
          <ul>
					<li>					To insert non-printing text, go to [<em>Insert &gt; Fields &gt; Other… &gt; Functions &gt; Hidden text</em>]. 
					<li>					To insert a non-printing paragraph, go to [<em>Insert &gt; Fields &gt; Other… &gt; Functions &gt; Hidden Paragraph</em>].

<h3 class="section">2.22 Hyphenation</h3>

<p>			
     <ul>
				<li>				The user can choose to split words at the end of Braille lines if they are too long. This will
				improve the layout of paragraphs. To enable hyphenation, check the corresponding box in
				[<em>File &gt; Braille Settings… &gt; General</em>]. 
				<li>				For most languages, odt2braille has a hyphenation dictionary for automatic breaking of words. 
				In addition, a word at the end of a Braille line is always split when it contains a <em>hard hyphen</em>,
				i.e. a plain minus sign ( - ). This allows for manual hyphenation. 
				A more elegant solution is to use <em>soft hyphens</em>, which are not brailled when the word
				appears in the middle of a Braille line. To insert a soft hyphen, go to
				[<em>Insert &gt; Formatting Mark &gt; Optional Hyphen</em>]. They are only visible in OpenOffice.org
				when [<em>View &gt; Field Shadings</em>] is checked. 
				<blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> Soft hyphens can only be used in Windows.

     <ul>
				<li>				When you use the same Braille settings and layout frequently, it may be a good idea to store
				these settings and layout in a <em>template</em>. Simply save your document as
				<em>ODF Text Document Template (.ott)</em>. 
				<li>				odt2braille also includes some predefined, real handy Braille templates. One for a simple
				Braille document and one for a more advanced, multi-volume Braille document. Both templates
				contain a preliminary section with a titlepage. You can find them under
				[<em>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and Documents &gt; Templates &gt; Braille Documents</em>].
