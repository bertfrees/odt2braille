@unnumberedsec Installation

In order to install odt2braille, OpenOffice.org version 3.0 or later is required. 
You can find the latest version of OpenOffice.org at @url{http://download.openoffice.org/@/other.html}.
It is strongly recommended that you also download and install the @emph{SimBraille} font: 
@url{http://odt2braille.svn.sourceforge.net/@/viewvc/@/odt2braille/@/Odt2BrailleAddOn/@/extra/@/simbrl.ttf}.
To add the odt2braille extension, launch OpenOffice.org and open [@emph{Tools > Extension Manager...}].
First remove any older versions of odt2braille. Then choose @emph{Add...}, select the odt2braille 
installation package and follow the steps. Finally, when the installation is finished, restart OpenOffice.org.

You can download the latest version of odt2braille from @url{http://odt2braille.@/sourceforge.@/net/@/downloads.html}.

@unnumberedsec OpenOffice.org accessibility

OpenOffice.org is poorly accessible with traditional screen readers on Windows. 
Accessing OpenOffice.org with the newer screen reader NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) appears to work better. 
Mac OS users can access OpenOffice.org with VoiceOver; Linux users can access it with Orca.

@unnumberedsec Getting started

In this guide you will learn how to create a document in OpenOffice.org Writer and prepare it for Braille 
production. Chapter 1 explains all you have to know to get started real quickly. In chapter 2 you will find 
a more comprehensive reference. You can find more help on working with Writer at 
@url{http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/@/wiki/@/Documentation/@/OOo3_User_Guides/@/Writer_Guide}.

After installing odt2braille, a whole new range of user preferences will become available.
Because of the broad range of Braille formatting conventions in use worldwide, odt2braille provides a lot of
flexibility. Users are able to adjust the Braille layout in detail, just like they can fully customize
the print layout.

To make sure that non-technical users will not be overwhelmed with possibilities, they have the option to choose
from a series of @emph{formal} Braille rules, e.g. the @emph{BANA principles of print to Braille transcription}
(see @url{http://www.brl.org/formats/}). This will considerably limit their freedom, but it will also greatly
simplify the production of valid and well-formatted Braille.

What follows next is a detailed overview of all possibilities odt2braille offers.

			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				OpenOffice.org allows you to write documents in various languages or mix multiple languages within the 
				same document. You can set the language for the whole document, individual paragraphs, or even 
				individual words and characters. The language tools can be found in [@emph{Tools > Languages}].
				@item
				Languages can be associated with @emph{Braille translation tables} in [@emph{File > Braille Settings…}]. The 
				translation table for the whole document can be set with the main language option
				on the @emph{General} tab. A contraction level can also be chosen. If the document contains 
				multiple languages, each additional language can be linked to a translation table and contraction 
				level in the @emph{Languages} tab.
				@item
				Translation tables are available for all West-European languages, Modern Hebrew, some Asian languages 
				and even some minority languages like Gaelic and Esperanto.

					@item
					or on the @sectionref{Title Page,title page}
				@end itemize
				
				will be transcribed as Braille paragraphs.
			@end itemize

		@subheading Braille

			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				By default, paragraphs are rendered in @emph{indented paragraph style} (first line cell 3, runovers cell 1
				and	not separated by blank lines. These settings can be altered in [@emph{File > Braille Settings > Paragraphs}].
				Empty paragraphs are dropped.
			@end itemize

	@node Headings
	@section Headings

		@subheading OpenOffice.org

			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				In order for a paragraph to be interpreted by odt2braille as a @emph{heading}, 
				following conditions must be true:
				
				@itemize @minus
					@item
					An @emph{outline level} has to be assigned to the text.
					This can be achieved in two ways:
					
					@itemize @minus
						@item
						Outline levels can be permanently linked to paragraph styles in [@emph{Tools > Outline Numbering}].
						@item
						If no outline level is linked to the current paragraph style, a level can still be assigned 
						to the text by setting @emph{Outline Level} in [@emph{Format > Paragraph > Outline & Numbering}].
					@end itemize
					
					The navigator [@emph{View > Navigator}] provides an overview of all headings and their outline levels.
					@item
					In addition, a heading should not be placed on the @sectionref{Title Page, title page} or inside a 
					@sectionref{Lists,list}, @sectionref{Tables,table} or @sectionref{Notes,note}.
				@end itemize
				
				@item
				To enable automatic numbering or bulleting of headings, set @emph{Numbering Style} 
				[@emph{Format > Paragraph > Outline & Numbering}] to @emph{Outline Numbering}.
				@item
				The exact formatting of bullets and numbers can be determined in [@emph{Tools - Outline Numbering}].
				Alternatively, choose [@emph{Format > Bullets & Numbering}] when a heading has the cursor.
			@end itemize

		@subheading Braille
			
			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				In Braille, headings are rendered in one of four heading styles:
				
				@itemize @minus
					@item
					Level 1 headings are centered and preceded and followed by a blank line.
					@item
					Level 2 headings are centered as well but are only preceded by a blank line.
					@item
					Level 3 headings begin in cell 5 (runovers too) and are preceded by a blank line.
					@item
					Headings with an outline level greater than 3 begin in cell 1 (runovers too) and are preceded by a blank line.
				@end itemize
				
				All these settings can be altered in [@emph{File > Braille Settings > Headings}].
				
				@item
				Numbers of headings are completely adopted in Braille.
				@item
				The transcription of bullets are left out.
				@item
				Empty headings are dropped.
				@item
				All @sectionref{Special Typeface,special typeface} in a heading is ignored.
				@item
				Only headings inside the @emph{body} of the document (not in the preliminary section)
				are included in the @sectionref{Table of Contents,table of contents}.
				@item
				Footnotes in headings: @pxref{Notes}.
				@item
				When a regular @sectionref{Volume Management,volume} (not a preliminary or supplementary volume) doesn't 
				start with a heading, odt2braille inserts a @emph{continuation heading}: the closest preceding heading is repeated
				and suffixed with the string "@kbd{(Cont.)}". This continuation heading is included in the table of contents as well.
				@tip{Always start a volume with a heading.}
			@end itemize

			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				Each paragraph with its @emph{Numbering Style} [@emph{Format > Paragraph > Outline & Numbering}] 
				set to anything but @emph{None} and @emph{Outline Numbering}, 
				will be interpreted by odt2braille as an item of a list.
				@item
				To produce a numbered or bulleted list in OpenOffice.org, either use the @emph{numbering} and @emph{bullets} 
				icons, or use @emph{list styles}.
				
				@itemize @minus
					@item
					The numbering and bullets icons can be found on the @emph{Formatting} toolbar 
					[@emph{View > Toolbars > Formatting}] or the @emph{Bullets and Numbering} toolbar 
					[@emph{View > Toolbars > Bullets and Numbering}].
					@item
					List styles can be selected in [@emph{Format > Styles and Formatting > List Styles}]. 
					When creating a new list style, make sure the name is not of the form @kbd{L1} / @kbd{L2} / @enddots{}
				@end itemize
				
				@item
				The @emph{level} of a listitem can be modified with keyboard shortcuts (@sc{tab} to move down a level, 
				@sc{shift} + @sc{tab} to move up a level) or with the @emph{Bullets and Numbering} toolbar.
				@item
				The exact formatting of lists can be determined in [@emph{Format > Bullets and Numbering}]. 
				Alternatively, if the list was created using list styles [@emph{Format > Styles and Formatting > List Styles}], 
				right click on the list style and choose @emph{Modify}.
			@end itemize

		@subheading Braille
			
			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				By default, lists are brailled as follows:
				
				@itemize @minus
					@item
					Level 1 listitems @emph{without} subitems begin in cell 1, runovers begin in cell 3.
					@item
					Level 1 listitems @emph{with} subitems begin in cell 1 as well, but runovers begin in cell 5.

					@item
					Listitems with an outline level greater than 3 begin in cell 7, runovers in cell 11.
				@end itemize

				Each entire list is preceded and following by a blank line. All these settings can be altered in
				[@emph{File > Braille Settings > Lists}].

				@item
				Numbers of listitems are completely adopted in Braille.
				@item
				The user can determine how bullets are brailled.
				@item
				@sectionref{Textboxes,Textboxes} and @sectionref{Images,images} that are anchored to a listitem are

			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				In OpenOffice.org, tables are created with [@emph{Table > Insert > Table}] or [@emph{Insert > Table}] 
				or with the @emph{Table} toolbar [@emph{View > Toolbars > Table}].
				@item
				The first row(s) of a table can be defined as @emph{column headings} by checking the @emph{Headings} box. 
				Set multiple heading rows by checking @emph{Repeat headings}.
				@item
				To add a @sectionref{Captions,caption} to the table, place the cursor inside the table and choose 
				[@emph{Insert > Caption}]. In order for a table caption to be correctly linked to the table, 
				it must be placed directly beneath the table and no other frame 
				(i.e. @sectionref{Textboxes,textbox} or @sectionref{Images,image}) can be anchored to it.
			@end itemize

		@subheading Braille
			
			@itemize @bullet

				@itemize @minus
					@item
					Column 1 table cells begin in cell 1, runovers too.
					@item
					Column 2 table cells begin in cell 3, runovers too.
					@item
					@enddots{}
					@item
					Table cells in column 10 and beyond begin in cell 19.
				@end itemize
				
				@item
				However, is it also possible to render tables in @emph{linear format}. In this case, all cells in a table row 
				are joined together. The user can choose the @emph{column delimiter} symbol which separates the cells.
				@item
				All table settings can be accessed in [@emph{File > Braille Settings > Tables}].
				@item
				Only regular text is retained in a table cell, all other elements are dropped or transposed.
				If a table cell contains multiple paragraphs, these are first serialized.
				@item
				Table lines are only shown in Braille if they are present in print. 
				A table line is represented by a series of unspaced Braille dots 2356 (top table line) or 1245 
				(bottom table line), extended across the full width of the Braille page. 
				A table inside a larger textbox is enclosed by full table lines (Braille dots 123456). 
				If no table lines are shown in print, the table is preceded and/or followed by a blank line.
				@item
				If column headings are present, these table rows are separated from the table body by a series of 
				unspaced Braille dots 25, extended across the full width of the Braille page.
				@item
				If a @sectionref{Captions,caption} is correctly linked to the table, it is centered and placed directly 
				below the top table line (or top blank line if the table line is absent). 
				A blank line is inserted between the caption and the actual table content. 
				@item
				All @sectionref{Notes,footnotes} are collected beneath the table body, but above the bottom table line 
				(or bottom blank line if the table line is absent). 
				Footnotes in the table caption are placed directly below the caption.
				@item
				Empty table cells are indicated with an ellipsis (Braille dots 5-5-5). 
				This usage is explained on the @sectionref{Transcriber's Notes,transcriber's notes page}.
				@item
				When a table contains other tables, @sectionref{Lists,lists}, @sectionref{Textboxes,textboxes} or 
				@sectionref{Images,images}, these elements are moved outside the table. 
				Every transposition is indicated by a double dash (Braille dots 36-36-36-36) at the element's original location. 
				An explaining @sectionref{Transcriber's Notes,transcriber's note} is inserted before the table. 
				Only after completion of the entire table, all previously omitted material is rendered. 
				Each element is preceded by another transcriber's note explaining it was moved from it's original location.
				@tip{Do not place other tables, lists, textboxes or images inside a table.}
				@item
				A merged table cell is processed as if its whole content were in the left- and uppermost 'sub'-cell. 
				The other (empty) 'sub'-cells are not shown in Braille.
				@tip{Try to avoid merged cells.}

		@subheading OpenOffice.org
		
			@itemize @bullet
				@item
				In OpenOffice.org, textboxes can be produced by choosing [@emph{Insert > Frame}]. 
				Options can be modified later in [@emph{Format > Frame/Object}]. 
				On the @emph{Type} tab, the anchor type can be selected. 
				The anchor is the basis of the position and behavior of the textbox within a document. 
				It makes the textbox move with the object it is anchored to. 
				You can anchor frames as a character or to a page, paragraph, or character. 
				In addition, if a textbox has been placed inside another textbox, it can be anchored to this outer frame. 
				The anchor is symbolized by a gray marker, which is only visible if the textbox is selected.
				@item
				To add a @sectionref{Captions,caption} to the textbox, place the cursor inside the textbox and choose 
				[@emph{Insert > Caption}]. In order for a caption to be correctly linked to the textbox by odt2braille, 
				one of the following must be true:
				
				@itemize @bullet
					@item
					The textbox is anchored to a caption.
					@item
					The paragraph immediately following the object the textbox is anchored to is a caption, 
					and no other frame (i.e. textbox or @sectionref{Images,image}) is anchored to it.
					@item
					The last paragraph of the textbox is a caption and no other frame is anchored to it.
