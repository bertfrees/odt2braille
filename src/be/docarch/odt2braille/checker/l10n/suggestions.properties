A_NoTitlePage=To create a title page, insert a section named TitlePage. The title page can be placed anywhere, but it is recommended to put it at the beginning of the document. If a preliminary section is present, place the title page inside of it, so that it is repeated in each volume.
A_NoPreliminarySection=
A_NoBrailleToc=If a table of contents is present in print, you should include it in Braille also. A table of contents can be automatically generated and attached at the end of the preliminary section of each volume. In order to achieve this, select the option Enable table of contents in the menu File > Braille Settings > Table of Contents.
A_NotInBrailleVolume=
A_OmittedInBraille=If it is important that all text in print is included in the Braille edition too, you should avoid using certain elements in OpenOffice.org.
A_TransposedInBraille=Do not place other tables, lists, textboxes or images inside a table. If you can't avoid it, these elements are moved outside the table and every transposition is indicated by a double dash (Braille dots 36-36-36-36) at the element's original location. An explaining transcriber's note is inserted before the table and only after completion of the entire table, all previously omitted material is rendered. Each element is preceded by another transcriber's note explaining it was moved. 
A_UnnaturalVolumeBreak=Ideally, each volume starts at a logical place such as the beginning of a new chapter.
