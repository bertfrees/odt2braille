Infile must be a pdf file. The script first calls the `pdftotext'
program, so you must have this installed on your machine. It is part
of xpdf. `pdftotext' is called with the '-raw' and '-' options, which
cause it to place its output on stdout. This is piped to `xml2brl',
which is called with the '-p' option, since output from `pdftotext' is
likely to be poorly formatted. The output file from `xml2brl' is
mostly in sensible paragraphs.
