Infile must be a rich-text (rtf) file. The script first calls the
`rtf2xml' program, so you must have this installed on your machine.
You can find it on the downloads page of www.abilitiessoft.com.
rtf2brl produces an xml file with the root element `doc'. This is
piped to `xml2brl'. The output file from `xml2brl' contains much of
the formatting, including emphasis, of the rtf file.
